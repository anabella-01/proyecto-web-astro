Hello! This is my first project using the Astro framework. It's a responsive landing page that we gradually built up using the following tools:

Astro framework
TailwindCSS for styling
TypeScript
Initially, the project was created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

I find Astro to be a fascinating framework, and I’m excited to keep learning more about it.

Steps to run the project:
• npm install
• npm run dev
